# das-project
My Codecademy's Build Websites from Scratch website project called "Dasmoto's Arts &amp; Crafts." It is from Unit 3: Command Line and Git. In addition from building a website from scratch using html and css, I had to use my bash command shell on my Mac using git to transfer this website I created within my Atom text editor to GitHub.
